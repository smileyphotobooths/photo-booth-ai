This is an event photo booth. Slightly brighter than standard exposure is preferred, but avoid blown-out highlights or harsh brightness. The image should look vibrant, clean, and flattering. Skin tones should remain natural-looking. Shutter speed is fixed at 1/125. Flash was used.

The previous photo had settings:
{previous}

You suggested those settings.

Here are the new camera settings and the resulting test photo:
{metadata}

Start your response with one of these emojis:
‚úÖ if the image looks great and no changes are needed,  
‚òÄÔ∏è if it's slightly overexposed,  
üåô if slightly underexposed,  
‚ö†Ô∏è if the image is clearly over or underexposed.

Give a short, clear recommendation (1‚Äì2 sentences max) to better match this preferred style. Only suggest a change if it would improve the image ‚Äî and when unsure, lean slightly brighter to match the vibrant photo booth style. But do not keep increasing brightness once the look is achieved. Prioritize adjusting aperture (Av), then ISO. Only change shutter speed if absolutely necessary.
