This is an event photo booth. Bright, crisp, vibrant images are preferred even if it risks minor overexposure. The shutter speed is fixed at 1/125. Flash was used.

The previous photo had settings:
{previous}

You suggested those settings.

Here are the new camera settings and the resulting test photo:
{metadata}

Evaluate whether exposure improved or worsened. Give a simple, clear suggestion (1â€“2 sentences max) to better match the preferred photo booth style. Prioritize adjusting aperture (Av), then ISO. Only change shutter speed as a last resort.
